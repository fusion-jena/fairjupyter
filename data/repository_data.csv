Our study utilized the whole-exome sequencing genome dataset of 2000 European descent patients collected from the GEN-COVID Multicenter Study group (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04549831) coordinated by the University of Siena. The whole-exome genome sequencing dataset contained 1.057M genetic variants of the patients. We used the 2000 patients’ original phenotype information to filter only patients with severity and asymptomatic across all classification criteria (841 patients). We introduced an innovative variant screening strategy that applied K-stratified fold splits of the original dataset to randomly draw a unique 5-fold pool of variants using the patients’ original phenotype information (841 unique patients).","2021-11-12 01:58:33","2021-11-19 09:15:24","2023-04-02 23:12:33",12562,"","{'Jupyter Notebook': 11100058, 'Python': 52833}",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,,,1,2,1,0,739,464

To investigate the evolution of resistance in this species we generated a chromosome-scale genome assembly and living panel of >110 fully sequenced globally sampled clonal lines. Our analyses reveal a remarkable diversity of resistance mutations segregating in global populations of M. persicae. We show that the emergence and spread of these mechanisms are influenced by host-plant associations, uncovering the widespread co‐option of a host-plant adaptation that also offers resistance against synthetic insecticides. We identify both the repeated evolution of independent resistance mutations at the same locus, and multiple instances of the evolution of novel resistance mechanisms against key insecticides. Our findings provide fundamental insights into the genomic responses of global insect populations to strong selective forces, and hold practical relevance for the control of pests and parasites.","2021-02-14 21:27:36","2022-10-12 18:18:01","2021-04-06 12:50:53",13147,,"{'Jupyter Notebook': 24872266, 'R': 226552}",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,,,0,4,0,0,2489,1555

NetDecoder is based on network flow algorithm and formulated as a minimum-cost flow optimization problem to identify and prioritize paths and key regulators within disease specific subnetworks. NetDecoder is designed to capture molecular switches and infer disease-specific networks to better understand pathways and identify key regulators that contribute to a disease phenotype. NetDecoder has extensive documentation and tutorial with free software package downloadable for the research communities. You can use NetDecoder on-line by uploading your data here, or you can download and run NetDecoder locally on your computer.

While there have been demonstrations of controlled nanoscale manipulation of domain structures to drive emergent properties, such approaches lack an internal feedback loop required for automation. Here, using a deep sequence-to-sequence autoencoder we automate the extraction of features of nanoscale ferroelectric switching from multichannel hyperspectral band-excitation piezoresponse force microscopy of tensile-strained PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 with a hierarchical domain structure. Using this approach, we identify characteristic behavior in the piezoresponse and cantilever resonance hysteresis loops, which allows for the classification and quantification of nanoscale-switching mechanisms. Specifically, we are able to identify elastic hardening events which are associated with the nucleation and growth of charged domain walls. This work demonstrates the efficacy of unsupervised neural networks in learning features of the physical response of a material from nanoscale multichannel hyperspectral imagery and provides new capabilities in leveraging multimodal in operando spectroscopies and automated control for the manipulation of nanoscale structures in materials.","2018-09-26 01:41:16","2023-03-26 02:31:57","2022-06-21 21:30:58",130895,,"{'Jupyter Notebook': 7950496, 'Python': 126461}",17,4,17,12,12,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,"BSD 3-Clause ""New"" or ""Revised"" License",bsd-3-clause,4,24,5,1,4107,2592

The prototype has been used for the validation from the domain experts of the methodology presented in the paper. In particular, it allows the experts to extract the causality information from the biomedical ontologies and represent causal hypotheses as directed graphs, where nodes are participating factors and arcs are directed causality relationships. Furthermore, it allows to asses the confidence in a causal hypothesis, which depends on the provided evidence for the factors and on the amount of causality information.","2017-04-20 16:14:16","2017-04-20 16:16:08","2017-04-21 13:55:32",13322,,"{'Jupyter Notebook': 5468249, 'HTML': 1161268, 'Python': 199644, 'Web Ontology Language': 18706, 'Shell': 212}",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,"Apache License 2.0",apache-2.0,0,72,0,0,4858,3101
